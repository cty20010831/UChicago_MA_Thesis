A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Properties of the startle probe (including sensory modality, intensity, aversiveness, task, timing, laterality, and response) and of the perceptual stimulus (including duration, repetition, blocking, intensity, and semantic or emotional category) are discussed as they impact on the pattern of affective startle modulation.

	abstract = {Changepoint detection is the problem of estimating the point at which the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. Over the years several multiple changepoint search algorithms have been proposed to overcome this challenge. They include binary segmentation algorithm, the Segment neighbourhood algorithm and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm. The PELT algorithm is exact and under mild conditions has a computational cost that is linear in the number of data points. PELT is more accurate than binary segmentation and faster as than other exact search methods. However, there is scanty literature on the sensitivity/power of PELT algorithm as the changepoints approach the extremes and as the size of change increases. In this paper, we implemented the PELT algorithm which uses a common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. The study used simulated data to determine the power of the PELT test. The study investigated the power of the PELT algorithm in relation to the size of the change and the location of changepoints. It was observed that the power of the test, for a given size of change, is almost the same at all changepoints location. Also, the power of the test increases with the increase in size of change.},

However, it is not well understood whether this effect is due to affective valence (pleasantness), arousal (activation), or a combination of both. Across four studies, we set out to investigate the role of positive moods on cognitive and behavioral measures of self-regulation in an ego-depletion paradigm. In studies 1 and 2, we independently manipulated affective valence and arousal and assessed self-regulation with a Stroop task. Results did not suggest a restorative effect of either on cognitive resources. In study 3, we employed both behavioral (the ‘handgrip task’) and cognitive (Stroop) assessments of self-regulation. Again, no significant effect of mood was observed on the Stroop task. Additionally, participants did not persist significantly longer on the handgrip task following a positive mood induction. Finally, in study 4, high vs. low states of arousal were manipulated and self-regulation was assessed via pre- and post-manipulation Stroop performance. In study 4, Stroop performance improved slightly more across time points for those in the high arousal condition than for those in the low arousal condition. Therefore, across four studies, we failed to find a consistent pattern of results suggesting that positive moods restore cognitive resources.},

Moreover, these findings were partially explained by 1 positive mood state (enthusiasm) that had been measured immediately after the completion of the preliminary task.

	abstract = {Flexibility of thought is theorized to play a critical role in the ability of high creative individuals to generate novel and innovative ideas. However, this has been examined only through indirect behavioral measures. Here we use network percolation analysis (removal of links in a network whose strength is below an increasing threshold) to computationally examine the robustness of the semantic memory networks of low and high creative individuals. Robustness of a network indicates its flexibility and thus can be used to quantify flexibility of thought as related to creativity. This is based on the assumption that the higher the robustness of the semantic network, the higher its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that the semantic network of high creative individuals is more robust to network percolation compared with the network of low creative individuals and that this higher robustness is related to differences in the structure of the networks. Specifically, we find that this higher robustness is related to stronger links connecting between different components of similar semantic words in the network, which may also help to facilitate spread of activation over their network. Thus, we directly and quantitatively examine the relation between flexibility of thought and creative ability. Our findings support the associative theory of creativity, which posits that high creative ability is related to a flexible structure of semantic memory. Finally, this approach may have further implications, by enabling a quantitative examination of flexibility of thought, in both healthy and clinical populations.},

Thus, creative individuals are characterized by “flat” (broader associations) instead of “steep” (few, common associations) associational hierarchies. To study these differences, we implement a novel computational approach to the study of semantic networks, through the analysis of free associations. The core notion of our method is that concepts in the network are related to each other by their association correlations - overlap of similar associative responses (“association clouds”). We began by collecting a large sample of participants who underwent several creativity measurements and used a decision tree approach to divide the sample into low and high creative groups. Next, each group underwent a free association generation paradigm which allowed us to construct and analyze the semantic networks of both groups. Comparison of the semantic memory networks of persons with low creative ability and persons with high creative ability revealed differences between the two networks. The semantic memory network of persons with low creative ability seems to be more rigid, compared to the network of persons with high creative ability, in the sense that it is more spread out and breaks apart into more sub-parts. We discuss how our findings are in accord and extend Mednick’s (1962) theory and the feasibility of using network science paradigms to investigate high level cognition.},

	abstract = {Complex dynamic behaviour involves reciprocal influences between emotion and cognition. On the one hand, emotion is a “double-edged sword” that may affect various aspects of our cognition and behaviour, by enhancing or hindering them and exerting both transient and long-term influences. On the other hand, emotion processing is also susceptible to cognitive influences, typically exerted in the form of emotion regulation. Noteworthy, both of these reciprocal influences are subjective to individual differences that may affect the way we perceive, experience, and eventually remember emotional experiences, or respond to emotionally challenging situations. Understanding these relationships is critical, as unbalanced emotion–cognition interactions may lead to devastating effects, such as those observed in mood and anxiety disorders. The present review analyses the reciprocal relationships between emotion and cognition, based on evidence derived from brain imaging investigations focusing on three main topics: (1) the impact of emotion on cognition, (2) the impact of cognition on emotion, and (3) the role of individual differences in emotion–cognition interactions. This evidence will be discussed in the context of identifying aspects that are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms underlying emotion–cognition interactions in healthy functioning, and to understanding changes associated with affective disorders.},

	abstract = {The visual modality is central to both reception and expression of human creativity. Creativity assessment paradigms, such as structured drawing tasks Barbot (2018), seek to characterize this key modality of creative ideation. However, visual creativity assessment paradigms often rely on cohorts of expert or naïve raters to gauge the level of creativity of the outputs. This comes at the cost of substantial human investment in both time and labor. To address these issues, recent work has leveraged the power of machine learning techniques to automatically extract creativity scores in the verbal domain (e.g., SemDis; Beaty \& Johnson 2021). Yet, a comparably well-vetted solution for the assessment of visual creativity is missing. Here, we introduce AuDrA – an Automated Drawing Assessment platform to extract visual creativity scores from simple drawing productions. Using a collection of line drawings and human creativity ratings, we trained AuDrA and tested its generalizability to untrained drawing sets, raters, and tasks. Across four datasets, nearly 60 raters, and over 13,000 drawings, we found AuDrA scores to be highly correlated with human creativity ratings for new drawings on the same drawing task (r = .65 to .81; mean = .76). Importantly, correlations between AuDrA scores and human raters surpassed those between drawings’ elaboration (i.e., ink on the page) and human creativity raters, suggesting that AuDrA is sensitive to features of drawings beyond simple degree of complexity. We discuss future directions, limitations, and link the trained AuDrA model and a tutorial (https://osf.io/kqn9v/) to enable researchers to efficiently assess new drawings.},

	abstract = {What is everyday creativity? A capacity, a strategy, a process, all of these. It is a capability that is an intimate part of our daily lives and our personalities, yet it remains, for most of us, underdeveloped and, unfortunately, underacknowledged. Editor and leading creativity researcher Ruth Richards writes, "Everyday creativity is...fundamental to our very survival. With our everyday creativity, we adapt flexibly, we improvise, we try different options, whether we are raising a child, counseling a friend, fixing our home, or planning a fundraising event." In this provocative collection, an interdisciplinary group of eminent thinkers offer their thoughts on how embracing creativity--tapping into the "originality of everyday life"--can lead to improved physical and mental health and to new ways of thinking and experiencing the world and ourselves. They show how our creativity can help us live "in the moment," refine our views of human nature at an individual and a societal level, find spiritual meaning, and, ultimately, change our paradigms for survival-and for flourishing-in a world fraught with urgent challenges. Neither a dry treatise nor a manual, this anthology draws upon the latest research in the area to present a lively examination of the phenomenon and process of everyday creativity and its far-reaching ramifications for self, society, politics, human and cultural evolution, and our future.

The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of MIPs can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.},

We investigated three aspects of cognition vital to many visual artists: creative cognition, perception, and perception-to-action. We found that the art students became more creative via the reorganization of prefrontal white matter but did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant changes in perceptual ability or related neural activity in the art students relative to the control group. Moreover, the art students improved in their ability to sketch human ﬁgures from observation, and multivariate patterns of cortical and cerebellar activity evoked by this drawing task became increasingly separable between art and nonart students. Our ﬁndings suggest that the emergence of visual artistic skills is supported by plasticity in neural pathways that enable creative cognition and mediate perceptuomotor integration.},

Speciﬁcally, we addressed the fundamental question of what brain processes are relevant for the generation of genuinely new creative ideas, in contrast to the mere recollection of old ideas from memory. In general, creative idea generation (i.e., divergent thinking) was associated with extended activations in the left prefrontal cortex and the right medial temporal lobe, and with deactivation of the right temporoparietal junction. The generation of new ideas, as opposed to the retrieval of old ideas, was associated with stronger activation in the left inferior parietal cortex which is known to be involved in mental simulation, imagining, and future thought. Moreover, brain activation in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus was found to increase as a function of the creativity (i.e., originality and appropriateness) of ideas pointing to the role of executive processes for overcoming dominant but uncreative responses. We conclude that the process of idea generation can be generally understood as a state of focused internally-directed attention involving controlled semantic retrieval. Moreover, left inferior parietal cortex and left prefrontal regions may subserve the ﬂexible integration of previous knowledge for the construction of new and creative ideas.},

	abstract = {Creating visual art is one of the deﬁning characteristics of the human species, but the paucity of archaeological evidence means that we have limited information on the origin and evolution of this aspect of human culture. The components of art include colour, pattern and the reproduction of visual likeness. The 2D and 3D art forms that were created by Upper Palaeolithic Europeans at least 30 000 years ago are conceptually equivalent to those created in recent centuries, indicating that human cognition and symbolling activity, as well as anatomy, were fully modern by that time. The origins of art are therefore much more ancient and lie within Africa, before worldwide human dispersal. The earliest known evidence of ‘artistic behaviour’ is of human body decoration, including skin colouring with ochre and the use of beads, although both may have had functional origins. Zig-zag and criss-cross patterns, nested curves and parallel lines are the earliest known patterns to have been created separately from the body; their similarity to entopic phenomena (involuntary products of the visual system) suggests a physiological origin. 3D art may have begun with human likeness recognition in natural objects, which were modiﬁed to enhance that likeness; some 2D art has also clearly been inﬂuenced by suggestive features of an uneven surface. The creation of images from the imagination, or ‘the mind’s eye’, required a seminal evolutionary change in the neural structures underpinning perception; this change would have had a survival advantage in both tool-making and hunting. Analysis of early tool-making techniques suggests that creating 3D objects (sculptures and reliefs) involves their cognitive deconstruction into a series of surfaces, a principle that could have been applied to early sculpture. The cognitive ability to create art separate from the body must have originated in Africa but the practice may have begun at different times in genetically and culturally distinct groups both within Africa and during global dispersal, leading to the regional variety seen in both ancient and recent art. At all stages in the evolution of artistic creativity, stylistic change must have been due to rare, highly gifted individuals.},

            Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been extensively used to explore the functional neuroanatomy of cognitive functions. Here we review 275 PET and fMRI studies of attention (sustained, selective, Stroop, orientation, divided), perception (object, face, space/motion, smell), imagery (object, space/ motion), language (written/spoken word recognition, spoken/ no spoken response), working memory (verbal/numeric, object, spatial, problem solving), semantic memory retrieval (categorization, generation), episodic memory encoding (verbal, object, spatial), episodic memory retrieval (verbal, nonverbal, success, effort, mode, context), priming (perceptual, conceptual), and procedural memory (conditioning, motor, and nonmotor skill learning). To identify consistent activation patterns associated with these cognitive operations, data from 412 contrasts were summarized at the level of cortical Brodmann's areas, insula, thalamus, medial-temporal lobe (including hippocampus), basal ganglia, and cerebellum. For perception and imagery, activation patterns included primary and secondary regions in the dorsal and ventral pathways. For attention and working memory, activations were usually found in prefrontal and parietal regions. For language and semantic memory retrieval, typical regions included left prefrontal and temporal regions. For episodic memory encoding, consistently activated regions included left prefrontal and medial-temporal regions. For episodic memory retrieval, activation patterns included prefrontal, medial-temporal, and posterior midline regions. For priming, deactivations in prefrontal (conceptual) or extrastriate (perceptual) regions were consistently seen. For procedural memory, activations were found in motor as well as in non-motor brain areas. Analysis of regional activations across cognitive domains suggested that several brain regions, including the cerebellum, are engaged by a variety of cognitive challenges. These observations are discussed in relation to functional specialization as well as functional integration.},

Based on animal studies, the amygdala is posited to be involved in fear-related responding.3,4 We found support of this hypothesis from human imaging studies such that stimuli that signal threat (eg, fearful faces) had a strong association with the amygdala. Over 60\% of studies that examined fear activated the amygdala (Figure 1). Several lines of evidence support the notion that the amygdala is responsible for detecting, generating, and maintaining fear-related emotions. Based on both animal work, human lesion, and imaging studies, the amygdala has been consistently implicated in fear conditioning,4,18 the recognition of fearful facial expressions,19,20 feelings of fear after procaine induction,21 and the evocation of fearful emotional responses from direct stimulation.22 The amygdala also appears important in the detection of environment threat,23-25 as well as in the coordination of appropriate responses to threat and danger.26-28 Of the eight studies9,25,29-34 that examined cerebral responses to fearful faces, six pointed to the critical involvement of the amygdala. Fear-associated amygdalar activations also extended into other modalities such as words24 and vocalizations.25 Morris and colleagues29 found that the amygdalar response to fearful faces showed a significant interaction with the intensity of emotion (increasing with increasing fearfulness).},

Direct evidence of the effect of sad mood on cognition is surprisingly limited, however. Published studies have generally addressed a single cognitive ability per study because the fleeting nature of laboratory-induced mood precludes extended testing, and robust findings are limited to mood effects on memory for emotional stimuli. In this study, sad mood was induced and prolonged, enabling the effects of mood to be assessed for an array of abilities, including those that share neural substrates with sad mood and those affected by depression. Sad mood affected memory for emotional words and facial emotion recognition, but not the other processes measured, with a significant nonuniformity of effect over tasks. These results are consistent with circumscribed effects of sad mood on certain emotion-related cognitive processes, but not on cognition more generally.},

In a completely between-groups design, 60 dextral women were administered either the positive or negative conditions of the Velten Mood Induction Procedure, and they subsequently completed either a verbal or figural fluency test. Euphoria resulted in better verbal than figural fluency performance, and dysphoria yielded better figural than verbal fluency outcomes. These findings are consistent with electrophysiological data concerning frontal lobe activity during euphoric and dysphoric affect, and they underscore the notion that affective influences upon cognition are more complicated than previously thought.},

Under neutral conditions involving no feedback, subjects showed a right visual field (RVF) advantage along with a phasic alerting effect (i.e., reaction times were faster to targets following cues at intermediate stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs)). When emotional value was added to the task, the RVF advantage increased following failure and decreased following success feedback. This effect peaked at intermediate SOAs, corresponding with the buildup of phasic arousal initiated by the cues. It was not influenced by the location of the pretarget cues, suggesting that attentional processes are not directly involved.

	abstract = {Creative thinking is thought to be supported by both spontaneous associative and controlled executive processes. Recently, a new measure of associative cognition has been developed—forward flow—which uses computational semantic models (e.g., latent semantic analysis; LSA) to capture “how far” people travel in semantic space during a chained free association task. The present research aims to extend the psychometrics of forward flow by 1) leveraging multiple computational semantic models for forward flow computation (reliability) and 2) testing how this metric of associative ability relates to divergent creative thinking (validity). In addition, using structural equation modeling, we test dual-process theories of creative cognition by examining the relative contribution of associative and executive abilities to divergent thinking. Study 1 (n = 151) finds moderately improved reliability of forward flow using the new multi-model approach (compared to LSA only), as well as positive effects of both forward flow (β = .48) and general intelligence (β = .36) on divergent thinking (human creativity ratings) in the same structural regression model. This pattern of results was replicated in Study 2 (n = 150), which showed large effects of forward flow (β = .42) and general intelligence (β = .46) on divergent thinking. The results expand the psychometrics of forward flow and provide new evidence for dual process models of creative cognition.},

A key question is whether something as elusive as creativity can be evaluated in a systematic way that goes beyond subjective judgments. To answer this question, we tested whether human evaluations of the creativity of short stories can be predicted by: (1) established measures of creativity and (2) computerized linguistic analyses of the stories. We conducted two studies, in which college students (with and without interest and experience in creative writing) wrote short stories based on a writing prompt. Independent raters (six in Study 1, five in Study 2) assessed the stories using an evaluation rubric specifically designed to assess aspects of creativity, on which they showed high interrater reliability. We provide evidence of convergent validity, in that the rubric evaluations correlated with established creativity measures, including measures of divergent thinking, associative fluency, and self-reported creative behavior and achievements. Linguistic properties of the short stories were analyzed with two computerized text analysis tools: Coh-Metrix, which analyzes aspects of text cohesion and readability, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, which identifies meaningful psychological categories of the text content. Linguistic features predicted the human ratings of creativity to a significant degree. These results provide novel evidence that creative writing can be evaluated reliably and in a systematic way that captures objective features of the text. The results further establish our evaluation rubric as a useful tool to assess creative writing.},

	abstract = {This article outlines a framework of creativity based on functional neuroanatomy. Recent advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience have identified distinct brain circuits that are involved in specific higher brain functions. To date, these findings have not been applied to research on creativity. It is proposed that there are four basic types of creative insights, each mediated by a distinctive neural circuit. By definition, creative insights occur in consciousness. Given the view that the working memory buffer of the prefrontal cortex holds the content of consciousness, each of the four distinctive neural loops terminates there. When creativity is the result of deliberate control, as opposed to spontaneous generation, the prefrontal cortex also instigates the creative process. Both processing modes, deliberate and spontaneous, can guide neural computation in structures that contribute emotional content and in structures that provide cognitive analysis, yielding the four basic types of creativity. Supportive evidence from psychological, cognitive, and neuroscientific studies is presented and integrated in this article. The new theoretical framework systematizes the interaction between knowledge and creative thinking, and how the nature of this relationship changes as a function of domain and age. Implications for the arts and sciences are briefly discussed.},

We termed the new construct divergent semantic integration (DSI), defined as the extent to which a narrative connects divergent ideas. Across nine studies, 27 different narrative prompts, and over 3500 short narratives, we compared six models of DSI that varied in their computational architecture. The best-performing model employed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which generates context-dependent numerical representations of words (i.e., embeddings). BERT DSI scores demonstrated impressive predictive power, explaining up to 72\% of the variance in human creativity ratings, even approaching human inter-rater reliability for some tasks. BERT DSI scores showed equivalently high predictive power for expert and nonexpert human ratings of creativity in narratives. Critically, DSI scores generalized across ethnicity and English language proficiency, including individuals identifying as Hispanic and L2 English speakers. The integration of creativity and distributional semantics theory has substantial potential to generate novel hypotheses about creativity and novel operationalizations of its underlying processes and components. To facilitate new discoveries across diverse disciplines, we provide a tutorial with code (osf.io/ath2s) on how to compute DSI and a web app (osf.io/ath2s) to freely retrieve DSI scores.},

	abstract = {The assessment of creativity presents major challenges. The many competing and complementary ideas on measuring creativity have resulted in a wide diversity of measures, making it difficult for potential users to decide on their appropriateness. Prior research has proposed creativity assessment taxonomies, but we argue that these have shortcomings because they often were not designed to (a) assess the essential assessment features and (b) are insufficiently specified for reliably categorizing extant measures. Based on prior categorization approaches, we propose a new framework for categorizing creativity measures including the following attributes: (a) measurement approach (self-report, other-report, ability tests), (b) construct (e.g., creative interests and attitudes, creative achievements, divergent thinking), (c) data type generated (e.g., questionnaire data vs. accomplishments counts), (d) prototypical scoring method (e.g., consensual assessment technique; CAT), and (e) psychometric problems. We identified 228 creativity measures appearing in the literature since 1900 and classified each measure according to their task attributes by two independent raters (rater agreement Cohen’s kappa .83 to 1.00 for construct). We provide a summary of convergent validity evidence and psychometric shortcomings. We conclude with recommendations for using the taxonomy and some psychometric desiderata for future research.},

	abstract = {Emotion is a central quality of human existence, and most of one’s behavior, motivation, and thought is enriched with and influenced by emotions. One’s relationship with the world is essentially affective, which means that all the interactions imply and involve emotions, whether these are interactions with the social world or with the material one. A product, or using a product, can elicit disappointment, attraction, shame, pride, disgust, contempt, admiration, satisfaction, fear, anger, and any other emotion a person may also experience in response to events, people, or actions of people. This chapter provides a general analysis of the phenomenon emotion, focusing on some basic questions: what is emotion, how can it be differentiated from other affective phenomena, what manifestations are associated with it, why do humans experience it, and how is it elicited? The review provides some basic answers to these questions that on the one hand are drawn from recent insights in emotion theory and on the other hand are not estranged from the everyday notion of what (product) emotion is. Some of the latest insights in emotion psychology are discussed, building on fundamental contributions to the science of emotion. Besides emotion, mood and affect disposition are also briefly discussed because they influence, and are related to, emotion. This chapter provides some background knowledge and a foundation for the model and sources of product emotions. It introduces the key variables of a basic product emotion model that was developed on the basis of an appraisal approach to emotion. In addition, two alternative approaches to product emotion are discussed: the pleasure approach of Jordan (2000), and the process-level approach of Norman (2004). Furthermore, it discusses sources of product emotions and uses examples to illustrate the different ways in which product emotion can be elicited.},

	abstract = {Creativity research requires assessing the quality of ideas and products. In practice, conducting creativity research often involves asking several human raters to judge participants’ responses to creativity tasks, such as judging the novelty of ideas from the alternate uses task (AUT). Although such subjective scoring methods have proved useful, they have two inherent limitations—labor cost (raters typically code thousands of responses) and subjectivity (raters vary on their perceptions and preferences)—raising classic psychometric threats to reliability and validity. We sought to address the limitations of subjective scoring by capitalizing on recent developments in automated scoring of verbal creativity via semantic distance, a computational method that uses natural language processing to quantify the semantic relatedness of texts. In five studies, we compare the top performing semantic models (e.g., GloVe, continuous bag of words) previously shown to have the highest correspondence to human relatedness judgements. We assessed these semantic models in relation to human creativity ratings from a canonical verbal creativity task (AUT; Studies 1–3) and novelty/creativity ratings from two word association tasks (Studies 4–5). We find that a latent semantic distance factor—comprised of the common variance from five semantic models—reliably and strongly predicts human creativity and novelty ratings across a range of creativity tasks. We also replicate an established experimental effect in the creativity literature (i.e., the serial order effect) and show that semantic distance correlates with other creativity measures, demonstrating convergent validity. We provide an open platform to efficiently compute semantic distance, including tutorials and documentation (https://osf.io/gz4fc/).},

The validity of these scoring methods was tested against TTCT’s manual-based scoring and a subjective snapshot scoring method. Results indicated that text-mining systems are applicable to both UUT and JST items across both forms and students’ performance on those items can predict total originality and creativity scores across all six tasks in the TTCT-Verbal. Comparatively, the text-mining methods worked better for UUT than JST. Of the three text-mining models we tested, the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GLoVe) model produced the most reliable and valid scores. These findings indicate that creativity assessment can be done quickly and at a lower cost using text-mining approaches.},

The KL divergence between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is frequently needed in the fields of speech and image recognition. Unfortunately the KL divergence between two GMMs is not analytically tractable, nor does any efficient computational algorithm exist. Some techniques cope with this problem by replacing the KL divergence with other functions that can be computed efficiently. We introduce two new methods, the variational approximation and the variational upper bound, and compare them to existing methods. We discuss seven different techniques in total and weigh the benefits of each one against the others. To conclude we evaluate the performance of each one through numerical experiments.},

The employed order of the Taylor-series expansion and the number of components used for splitting allows balancing between accuracy and computational demand. The second contribution is the determination of meaningful and efﬁciently to calculate lower and upper bounds of the entropy, which can be also used for approximation purposes. In addition, a reﬁnement method for the more important upper bound is proposed in order to approach the true entropy value.},

Most recent research has focused on the interpretability of supervised models, whereas unsupervised learning has received less attention. However, the majority of the focus was on interpreting the whole model in a manner that undermined accuracy or model assumptions, while local interpretation received much less attention. Therefore, we propose an intrinsic interpretation for the Gaussian mixture model that provides both global insight and local interpretations. We employed the Bhattacharyya coefﬁcient to measure the overlap and divergence across clusters to provide a global interpretation in terms of the differences and similarities between the clusters. By analyzing the GMM exponent with the Garthwaite–Kock corrmax transformation, the local interpretation is provided in terms of the relative contribution of each feature to the overall distance. Experimental results obtained on three datasets show that the proposed interpretation method outperforms the post hoc model-agnostic LIME in determining the feature contribution to the cluster assignment.},

To clarify different subprocesses’ respective roles in creative work, this study investigated their frequencies and associations with creativity-related personal characteristics and product creativity. Undergraduate students (n = 266) articulated their creative thought processes via the think aloud method while completing an open-ended drawing task and completed questionnaires assessing creativity-relevant personal characteristics. Drawings were rated for creativity by quasi-expert judges. Transcripts were coded using an a priori coding scheme informed by models of the creative process, including generation (14\%), elaboration (26\%), association (9\%), selection (4\%), evaluation (13\%), anchoring (13\%), metacognition (7\%), and ﬁller (14\%). Subprocess frequencies correlated minimally with measures of personal characteristics, although several signiﬁcant, albeit weak, relationships emerged. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that the best predictors of drawing creativity were aesthetic ﬂuency, the frequency of anchoring, time spent on task, and, marginally, the frequency of generation. Together, these results provide insight into how relevant personal characteristics and subprocess engagement contribute to drawing creativity and highlight the particular importance of anchoring, which involves monitoring and reﬁning task-related goals and constraints, throughout the creative process.},

	abstract = {Emotion research has become a mature branch of psychology, with its own standardized measures, induction procedures, data-analysis challenges, and subdisciplines. During the last decade, a number of books addressing major questions in the study of emotion have been published in response to a rapidly increasing demand that has been fueled by an increasing number of psychologists whose research either focuses on or involves the study of emotion. Very few of these books, however, have presented an explicit discussion of the tools for conducting research, despite the facts that the study of emotion frequently requires highly specialized procedures, instruments, and coding strategies, and that the field has reached a point where a large number of excellent elicitation procedures and assessment instruments have been developed and validated. Handbook of Emotion Elicitation and Assessment corrects this oversight in the literature by organizing and detailing all the major approaches and instruments for the study of emotion. It is the most complete reference for methods and resources in the field, and will serve as a practical resource for emotion researchers by providing easy access to a host of scales, stimuli, coding systems, assessment tools, and innovative methodologies. This handbook will help to advance research in emotion by encouraging researchers to take greater advantage of standard and well-researched approaches, which will increase both the productivity in the field and the speed and accuracy with which research can be communicated.

We elicited the emotional states of being moved, amusement, attachment, and calmness by presenting participants with ﬁlm clips; we assessed their electromyographic, electrodermal, and cardiac responses to the ﬁlms. Further, we used a high- and low-arousal moving ﬁlm to examine the effect of different levels of arousal on facial and physiological responses to moving ﬁlms. We compared facial and physiological responses to positive-emotion and emotionally neutral ﬁlms. Analysis of subjective emotion scale ratings revealed that the ﬁlms had successfully elicited the target positive emotions and that the high- and low-arousal moving ﬁlms had elicited the feeling of being moved in accordance with the anticipated level of intensity. In comparison to the other types of positive-emotion ﬁlms, the two moving ﬁlms resulted in an increase in corrugator electromyography activity and skin conductance responses, which in turn were modulated by the arousal level of the moving ﬁlms. However, cardiac measures such as heart rate did not differ across the different ﬁlm conditions. These results suggest that ﬁlm clips can elicit different intensities of the emotional state of being moved and that facial muscle and electrodermal activities but not cardiac activity characterize the ﬁlm-induced emotional state of being moved.},

The setting includes presentation of emotional stimuli for sadness induction (emotional film clips), manipulative strategy for anger induction (interaction with human confederate) and real-life situation for induction of fear (examination situation). The paper also briefly presents the research EH (Emotionality in Handwriting, the Institute of Psychology of Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University in Brno, 2010) which is a follow-up to a study focused on the effects of a given emotional state on formal parameters of handwriting (on metric characteristics of handwriting). Apart from general commentary on induction methods, the design of the EH experiment is described, including description of each mood induction procedure method, course of the experimental setting and summary of results obtained from participants by self-description scales. The research results are also significant in that the emotional changes studied may provide vital information on behavioural and personality characteristics. This subject has been for a long time more or less neglected by current research tendencies. The article also provides a commentary on possibilities of development of the method within psychological disciplines.},

	abstract = {Despite six decades of creative cognition research, measures of creative ideation have heavily relied on divergent thinking tasks, which still suffer from conceptual, design, and psychometric shortcomings. These shortcomings have greatly impeded the accurate study of creative ideation, its dynamics, development, and integration as part of a comprehensive psychological assessment. After a brief overview of the historical and current anchoring of creative ideation measurement, overlooked challenges in its most common operationalization (i.e., divergent thinking tasks framework) are discussed. They include (1) the reliance on a single stimulus as a starting point of the creative ideation process (stimulus-dependency), (2) the analysis of response quality based on a varying number of observations across test-takers (ﬂuency-dependency), and (3) the production of “static” cumulative performance indicators. Inspired from an emerging line of work from the ﬁeld of cognitive neuroscience of creativity, this paper introduces a new assessment framework referred to as “Multi-Trial Creative Ideation” (MTCI). This framework shifts the current measurement paradigm by (1) offering a variety of stimuli presented in a well-deﬁned set of ideation “trials,” (2) reinterprets the concept of ideational ﬂuency using a time-analysis of idea generation, and (3) captures individual dynamics in the ideation process (e.g., modeling the effort-time required to reach a response of maximal uncommonness) while controlling for stimulus-speciﬁc sources of variation. Advantages of the MTCI framework over the classic divergent thinking paradigm are discussed in light of current directions in the ﬁeld of creativity research.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we review the typical methods that are used to create and measure the physical states and subjective feelings that researchers refer to as "affect" or "emotion," keeping in mind the scientific distinction between these two constructions. We refer to "affect" as the properties of any mental state that can be described as pleasant or unpleasant with some degree of arousal. These properties correspond to brain representations of some change in the core autonomic and hormonal systems of the body. There is no widely accepted operational definition of emotion. Sometimes writers describe emotion as coordinated packets of experiences, physiological changes, and behavior, but this is nonspecific because every waking moment of life there are coordinated changes of this sort. Furthermore, there remains tremendous debate over which mental states count as emotion versus which do not. In this chapter we take a simple approach: an "emotion" is a mental state to which people assign a commonsense name; when someone uses an "emotion" label, it implies they have invoked conceptual knowledge about emotion to make sense of or to communicate their internal state. From our perspective, inducing emotion necessarily involves a change in affect. This means that to make claims about emotion, it is necessary to ensure that findings do not simply reflect changes in valence or arousal. Furthermore, there are times when a scientist's intention to evoke an affective change in a participant produces an unexpected change in an emotion. With these considerations in mind, we very generally review the variety of induction methods and measurement techniques that are used most frequently in social and personality psychology. We highlight novel points related to inducing affect or emotions as experiences or states and discuss the most serious challenges that researchers face, the most serious being that at times the intent is to measure changes in emotion when the measurement tools only permit inferences about affect. Currently, there is no strong empirical justification for using any single objective measurement, or profile of measurements (in the face, body, or brain) to indicate when a person is in a state of anger, or fear, or sadness, and so on. People do not always scowl in anger, heart rate does not always go down in sadness, and people do not always freeze or run in fear. Reviews of the empirical literature have reached this conclusion again and again over the past hundred years. Yet it is possible to have a powerful and robust science of emotion, when induction methods are used judiciously and measurements are interpreted appropriately. This chapter is designed to help interested readers move forward in that direction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The interaction between these two dimensions is still a matter of debate. In this paper we provide a novel hypothesis concerning their interaction, by arguing that subjective arousal levels modulate the experience of a stimulus’ affective quality. All things being equal, the higher the arousal, the more a given stimulus would be experienced as pleasant (or unpleasant). While marshaling some preliminary evidence in favor of this hypothesis, we also show how it might be relevant in reframing our conception of depressive disorders (i.e., major and bipolar depression).},

Artificial intelligence, and more precisely deep learning, has displayed unprecedented performance in the automatic recognition and classification of large databases of sketches and drawings collected through touchpad devices. Although deep learning can perform these tasks with high accuracy, the way they are performed by the algorithms remains largely unexplored. Improving the interpretability of deep neural networks is a very active research area, with promising recent advances in understanding human cognition. Deep learning thus offers a powerful framework to study drawing behavior and the underlying cognitive processes, particularly in children and non-human animals, on whom knowledge is incomplete. In this literature review, we first explore the history of deep learning as applied to the study of drawing along with the main discoveries in this area, while proposing open challenges. Second, multiple ideas are discussed to understand the inherent structure of deep learning models. A non-exhaustive list of drawing datasets relevant to deep learning approaches is further provided. Finally, the potential benefits of coupling deep learning with comparative cultural analyses are discussed.},

However, recent work leveraging pen-tracking, computer vision, and online crowd-sourcing has revealed new ways to capture and objectively quantify drawings, to answer a wide range of questions across fields of psychology. Here, I present a tutorial on modern methods for drawing experiments, ranging from how to quantify pen-and-paper type studies, up to how to administer a fully closed-loop online experiment. I go through the concrete steps of designing a drawing experiment, recording drawings, and objectively quantifying them through online crowd-sourcing and computer vision methods. Included with this tutorial are code examples at different levels of complexity and tutorials designed to teach basic lessons about web architecture and be useful regardless of skill level. I also discuss key methodological points of consideration, and provide a series of potential jumping points for drawing studies across fields in psychology. I hope this tutorial will arm more researchers with the skills to capture these naturalistic snapshots of a mental image.},

While previous approaches rely on sequence-based models for drawings of basic objects or handwritten text, we propose a model that treats drawings as a collection of strokes that can be composed into complex structures such as diagrams (e.g., ﬂow-charts). At the core of the approach lies a novel autoencoder that projects variable-length strokes into a latent space of ﬁxed dimension. This representation space allows a relational model, operating in latent space, to better capture the relationship between strokes and to predict subsequent strokes. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our proposed approach is able to model the appearance of individual strokes, as well as the compositional structure of larger diagram drawings. Our approach is suitable for interactive use cases such as auto-completing diagrams. We make code and models publicly available at https://eth-ait.github.io/cose.},
