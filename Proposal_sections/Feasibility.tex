\subsection*{IRB Approval}
This proposed study is expected to receive IRB approval as it adheres to the four ethical principles (\cite{salganik_bit_2019}). First, it respects the honor of participants by providing them with informed consent before the experiment. Second, it maximizes potential benefits while minimizing potential harm to participants, as it does not induce negative mood states. Third, it treats every participant equally so that the benefits and risks are allocated fairly. Fourth, it complies with legal and public interest standards.

\subsection*{Timeline}
The proposed timeline for this study is described in Table \ref{tab: Proposed Timeline}.
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Quarter} & \textbf{Activities} \\
\hline
Summer & Implemented pilot study for pretesting from a sample of 30 MTurk workers \\
\hline
Next autumn & 1) Refined experiment website and research design based on feedback from pilot study; \newline 2) Published research design online and begin participant recruitment through MTurk for the main study. \\
\hline
Next winter & 1) Conduct data analysis; \newline 2) Complete the draft of the final thesis. \\
\hline
Next spring & Finalize and submit the thesis paper. \\

\subsection*{Cost}
Based on the pricing information provided in \href{https://requester.mturk.com/pricing}{Amazon Mechanical Turk website}, the total cost for each participant will be \$1.00 (base pay) + \$0.20 (MTurk fees) = \$1.20. For 300 participants, the total cost will be $\$1.20 \times 300 = \$360$.

\subsection*{Deep Learning Models and Computing Power}
As an integral part of this proposed study, deep learning models require considerable time and resources for both training and implementation. Fortunately, the pre-trained models and the running code for the two deep learning models that I plan to use (i.e., AuDrA and CoSE models) are publicly available online. Moreover, this proposed study will utilize university high-performance computing clusters (specifically, Midway 3) for potential deep learning model fine-tuning.

\subsection*{Supervisor}
Dr.~Akram Bakkour \footnote{Dr.~Bakkour is an assistant professor affilitated with the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago; see his \href{https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Akram-Bakkour}{school website profile}} has agreed to serve as the advisor for muy project. I have been working at Dr.~Bakkour's lab upon joining the MACSS program, and he has been quite familiar with my research project and also provided me with constructive feedback while I was improving this proposed project. I will benefit from Dr.~Bakkour's expertise in cognitive psychologist in terms of the overarching research design and also the proposal/paper drafting later.
