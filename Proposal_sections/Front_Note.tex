This MA thesis proposal (submitted on November 1, 2024 on Canvas) builds on the proposal I wrote in the spring quarter of 2024 (for MACS 30200 course) with the following major differences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This proposal incorporates changes in the sample characteristics for both my pilot and main studies, including the sample size and target of sample (changing from University of Chicago students to MTurk workers for the pilot study ).
    \item This proposal includes the re-ordering of the four blocks in my online experiment, with the survey part moved to the end. 
    \item This proposal incorporates changes in how I assess the effectiveness of mood induction (specifically, the adoption of the Self Assessment Manikin).
    \item This proposal provides more detailed information about the instructions that I provide to the participants (e.g., for the Self Assessment Manikin and the drawing task). 
    \item This proposal contains more information on the four control variables that I used in my study (alongside additional references to the three questionnaires I use). 
    \item This proposal updates the timeline table regarding the job I have done. 
    \item This proposal removes two potential advisors who did not go on board. 
\end{enumerate}
